# MuPeer
DEPRECATED -- use MuPeers 

MuPeer allows devices to communicate between devices on the same network. It works over both WiFi and/or Bluetooth. 

In real World use, it seems that turning off WiFi and using purely Bluetooth stutters a bit less -- probably due to QoS (Quality of Service) differences between the two.  

In the DeepMuse app, there is some noticeable gaps in fast drawing. Sometimes, the packets come in out of sequence. The solution would to include a time lag. That would allow the sender to include a timestamp and for the receiver to reassemble the timeline.
